- Explain the Entity class life-cycle ?

The lifecycle state of a newly instantiated entity object is called transient. The entity hasn’t been
persisted yet, so it doesn’t represent any database record.
Your persistence context doesn’t know about your newly instantiate object. Because of that, it doesn’t
 automatically perform an SQL INSERT statement or tracks any
 changes. As long as your entity object is in the lifecycle
 state transient, you can think of it as a basic Java object without any connection to the database and
  any JPA-specific functionality.
